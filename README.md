## Design Workflow  


Gradient Background: Create a visually appealing gradient background.

Toolbar: Include a navigation icon, user profile image, and username.

Chat View: Display messages with timestamps and status indicators.

Message Bar: Add an attachment icon, input field, and send button.

Attachment Overlay: Provide icons and text options for media selection.

## Recommendations

SVG should be used for drawables instead of PNG, as it allows for more consistent icons across various devices.
